# Digital Electronics

## Topics to cover: 

* Codes, Logic Gates, Combinational Circuits, KMaps, Encoder and Decoder circuits, Multiplexers and Demultiplexers, Adders, Subtractors, Comparators, Sequential Circuits, Flip Flops, Latches, Registers, Flip Flop Conversions, Synchronous/Asynchronous circuits, Clocked Circuits, FSMs, Mealy & Moore machines, Counters, State Reduction.

* Cover the whole of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XXZleXge9Ln2zPAVFiTrvuGpmNAsZpk">Neso Academy Digital Electronics</a> for the basics of digital electronics. They provide a short and to the point explanation of the topics. These lectures will build a strong foundation in digital electronics.

* Static Timing Analysis is another important topic. Refer to the following 2 lectures (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEj6LR-C84Y">Lecture 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrY0MzCBgAo">Lecture 2</a>) for this. Also read Parts 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 5a, 5b, 6a of <a href="http://www.vlsi-expert.com/2011/03/static-timing-analysis-sta-basic-timing.html">VLSI Expert.</a>

Refer two the next 2 lectures, [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqvZLAgoA-g&list=PLD5C0Wv5Dnmdv-B6NGOu4MA3yDlqFfdre&index=3), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R50lGuibylE&list=PLD5C0Wv5Dnmdv-B6NGOu4MA3yDlqFfdre&index=4) for some really helpful interview questions on Static timing Analysis.

* For understanding CMOS technology, refer to the following lectures: [Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faiEVOOCe-s&list=PLLy_2iUCG87Bdulp9brz9AcvW_TnFCUmM&index=2), [Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faiEVOOCe-s&list=PLLy_2iUCG87Bdulp9brz9AcvW_TnFCUmM&index=2), [Lecture 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwD1kNvzO_g&list=PLLy_2iUCG87Bdulp9brz9AcvW_TnFCUmM&index=6), [Lecture 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqliHhtHcM&list=PLLy_2iUCG87Bdulp9brz9AcvW_TnFCUmM&index=7). These cover the basics of MOSFETS and the CMOS inverter. 
  
* RC circuits play an important role in device parasitics(delays and energy dissipation), so it is important to understand how RC circuits work. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KylJ2v1_c-o&t=1403s) for the basics.

* It is important to know any one(interviewers mostly ask for verilog, but knowing vhdl also is not harmful) Hardware Definition Language(HDL) out of Verilog and VHDL. Refer to the books in this folder for the same. It is important to know how to code common combinational and sequential circuits, as well as finite state machines(both mealy and moore state machines). You can find the NPTEL course for verilog [here](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105165/).
