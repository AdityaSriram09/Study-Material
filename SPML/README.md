Aside from the books mentioned in this folder, you will find these resources helpful too:

* [ML By Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), One of the best courses for ML. Recommeded to Audit this course.

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) (Spealization - 4 courses) (Provides Examples and is really good for Practice, after you have a basic understanding)

* [Intro to AI with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python). Introductory but good overall. The projects are a nice practice.
